# Introduction to iOS Development

# Who am I?

--

## Intro
- Sam Shi ("Shy" )
- he/him/his
- B.S. Computer Science & Music Minor
- Fellow @ Computer Science Experience Lab

--

## My iOS Experience

![experience](../-images/experience.png)

---

# Who are you?

--

## Quick icebreaker...
1. Chat with a neighbor
2. Tell them your name
3. Find things that you have in common
4. Share these things with the group
5. The pair that found the most wins...
6. You have three minutes :)

--

## Around the room
- Your name & pronouns
- Years at UNC
- Majors and minors
- Favorite app and why

--

## Why'd I ask about your favorite app?
- I've been misleading you
- Workshop title is slightly deceiving

--

## What're you talking about?
- Not just learning how to build apps
- Learning to think critically about software

---

# Learning Objectives
What's the point of this workshop?

--

## Zoomed-Out Objectives

1. Demystify mobile applications
2. Learn to reason about user interfaces
3. Get exposure to iOS app development with SwiftUI
   - To accomplish 1 & 2

--

## What about iOS development?

- If you're super hyped about iOS, I'd love you to continue pursuing it
- Not everyone will remember what `HStack`, `VStack`, and `Spacer` do
- I hope everyone will walk away having learned a new way to think about UIs

--

## Zoomed-In Objectives

This workshop series will expose you to...
1. Fundamental Swift syntax and concepts
2. Thinking about a user interface as a collection of components
3. How to build user interfaces with SwiftUI
4. How to refactor a read-only UI to handle interaction and show dynamic data
5. Network requests (if time allows)

---

## Today

1. Learn anatomy of an Xcode project
2. Learn fundamental building blocks of SwiftUI
3. Learn fundamental Swift syntax and concepts
4. Start to think about how we might build a music player

---

# Let's hop in ðŸŽ‰

(disclaimer...)

--

## Technology Setup Disclaimer
- You should have Xcode & SF Symbols installed
- These are fantastic tools for app development

--

## What if I couldn't complete setup?
- That's fine!!
- Xcode isn't 100% required for today's work
- Will be necessary for Monday's session

---

# Demystifying Mobile Apps

--

## Mobile apps are just code
- All of your favorite apps are created with code
- Files full of if statements, functions, classes, etc.
- They are often complex, but understandable

---

# What are Swift and SwiftUI?

--

## Swift

> Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns. ([swift.org](https://www.swift.org/about/))

- Safe
- Fast
- Expressive

--

## SwiftUI

> Introduced at WWDC 2019, SwiftUI is a declarative UI framework from Apple that enables developers to build native user interfaces for apps running on either iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS or macOS. ([swiftbysundell.com](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/discover/swiftui/))

--

## âœ¨ The SwiftUI Mindset âœ¨

- Declarative, reactive programming framework.
- View is a function of the state
- Change of state â†’ view refresh
- Specify all different configurations up front vs. manually configuring them

--

## Example of declarative UI

```objective-c
- (UIEdgeInsets)setStateOne
{
    ...
    component.insets = UIEdgeInsetsOptionOne;
    ...
}

...

- (UIEdgeInsets)setStateTwo
{
    ...
    component.insets = UIEdgeInsetsOptionTwo;
    ...
}

...
```

```objective-c
- (UIEdgeInsets)edgeInsetsFor:(State)state
{
    if (state == StateOptionOne) {
        return UIEdgeInsetsOptionOne;
    } else if (state == StateOptionTwo) {
        return UIEdgeInsetsOptionTwo;
    } else if (state == StateOptionThree) {
        return UIEdgeInsetsOptionThree;
    } else {
        NSAssertionFalse(@"Unexpected state");
        return UIEdgeInsetsOptionOne;
    }
}
```

--

## (Some of) the benefits of declarative programming

- Prevents mismatches between the view and the data (common in imperative)
- Increases readability & refactorability
- Consolidates logic for a component into one place

---

# Building UIs with SwiftUI

--

## Let's take a look at an iOS app project

1. Open Xcode
2. "Create a new Xcode project"
3. In "iOS" tab, select "App"
4. Name it "csxl-ios-exploration"
5. Select "SwiftUI" as our Interface Framework
6. Select "Swift" as Language
7. Deselect "Use CoreData" and "Include Tests"

--

## Xcode Tour
- `csxl-ios-exploration.xcodeproj`
- Main `App` file
- `ContentView.swift`
- Asset Catalog
- Preview Content

--

## The Basic Views

--

## Text

Takes in a string and renders it on screen.

```swift
// Example
Text("Welcome to SwiftUI!")
```

--

## Image (custom image)

1. Add an image to our Asset Catalog in `assets.xcassets`
2. Give it a reasonable name and copy to clipboard.
3. Use the `Image(_ name: String)` initializer to render it on screen.

```swift
// Example
Image("csxl-logo")
```

--

## Image (SF Symbol)

Since iOS 13, the operating system provides a huge icon library that we are free to use.
- Very easy to obtain icons this way. No need to download icon sets.
- Common icons used across many iOS applications.
- Users know these icons.

```swift
// Example
Image(systemName: "square.and.arrow.up")
```

--

## SwiftUI Layout

There are only 3 ways to layout views in SwiftUI.
- `VStack` - vertical stack
- `HStack` - horizontal stack
- `ZStack` - (zertical?) stack on the Z axis

--

## Example Layout

```swift
VStack {
    HStack {
        Text("pfp")

        VStack {
            Text("Username")
            Text("Location")
        }

        Spacer() // spacer is new

        Text("Three dots")
    }

    Color.blue.aspectRatio(1, contentMode: .fit)

    HStack {
        Text("Like")
        Text("Comment")
        Text("Share")
        Spacer()
        Text("Dots")
        Spacer()
        Text("Save")
    }

    HStack {
        Text("caption")
        Spacer()
    }
}
```
